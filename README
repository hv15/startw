NAME
       startw - initialise a Wayland session

SYNOPSIS
       startw [-h] [-v] [-c CONFIG] [-k KEYBOARDCONF]

DESCRIPTION
       The  startw script is a front end to a Wayland shell (e.g. desktop man-
       ager) that provides a somewhat nicer user interface for running a  sin-
       gle Wayland session. It is typically run without any arguments.

       Much of the configuration for the Wayland shell is done through a shell
       specific configuration file. However, some settings can only  be  given
       through  command-line  arguments  and/or  environmental variables.  For
       instance, to configure the keyboard layout in most Wayland shells,  the
       following  environment  variables  need  to  be set: XKB_DEFAULT_RULES,
       XKB_DEFAULT_MODEL,       XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT,       XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT,
       XKB_DEFAULT_OPTION.  The  startw  script  handles  this  through the -k
       option (see below on how to use it).

       The script is analogues to the startx(1) and xinit(1) commands used  to
       initialise a X Window System session.

OPTIONS
       The arguments that are currently support by startx are:

       -h print out the usage message and exit.

       -v print out the version number and exit.

       -c specify a configuration file other than the default.

       -k specify  the  keyboard  settings  as  a  string  formatted  as "lay-
          out;model;variant;options", e.g. "us;;;ctrl:nocaps" for  a  US  key-
          board  with  no caps-lock. See xkeyboard-config(7) for more informa-
          tion.

FILES
       $(HOME)/.winitrc    Client to run. Typically a shell script which  runs
                           many programs in the background. (Default)

SEE ALSO
       startx(1), xinit(1)

BUGS
       No known bugs.
